# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Description

As required by the task and the acceptance criteria, I created a web application password generator. To accomplish this task I created a function that would create pop-up with a series of prompts when the "Generate Password" button is clicked. The prompts dictate the password length, and whether the password has upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. If the passord length that is chosen is between 8 and 128 and some or all of the character types are selected the password will be generated, based on what what selected, this is the happy path. If the passord length is below 8 and higher than 128, or if non of the character types are choosen, then a password not be generated and the user will be taken back to application.
